# Airline-passenger-satisfaction-prediction
This project was completed under the 3MTT program and involves building an XGBoost model to predict airline passenger satisfaction
By leveraging the XGBoost algorithm, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately classify passengers as satisfied or dissatisfied based on various features such as flight distance, seat comfort, and service quality.

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict passenger satisfaction. The project will cover the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in machine learning.
- Learn to implement and tune the XGBoost algorithm for classification tasks.
- Gain experience in evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Explore feature importance and interpret model results.
- Compare the performance of XGBoost with other models like Decision Trees and Random Forests.
